#### Abstract:
The structure of the human brain has evolved to achieve extraordinary computing power through continuous refinement by natural selection. At present, the topology of brain-like model lacks biological plausibility. In this paper, a new brain-like model is proposed, called fMRI-SNN, which is a spiking neural network (SNN) constrained by the topology of a functional brain network from human functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. To verify its performance, this fMRI-SNN is applied to speech recognition. Our results indicate that the recognition accuracy of fMRI-SNN is superior to that of SNNs with different topologies, and exhibits stronger performance on more difficult speech recognition tasks. Our discussion on recognition mechanism finds the advantage of fMRI-SNN is that the differences in its neuronal firing patterns are greater than those of other SNNs, since it has better information transmission ability.
